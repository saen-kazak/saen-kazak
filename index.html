<!--<h1 id="bantext">Minecraft Engineering!</h1>-->

<div id="intro-text"><p>

My name is Saen and I'm studying Computer Science at degree level. I'm also an avid Minecraft player of 10+ years. I'm going to use this to talk about some of the hobby projects I'm working on within the scope of the game, many of which often involve extensive use of mods, server administration, plugins and redstone engineering.

I try to keep all of my hobby projects neatly tied up into one minecraft server.

One of the things I've always loved about Minecraft is the game's ridiculous ability to create absolutely <i>anything.</i> Some things I am currently working on include building PAC-MAN inside of Minecraft as well as a maze of Super Mario themed minigames. I'm also simulating a British railway and implementing different ways to visually sort an input of blocks.
