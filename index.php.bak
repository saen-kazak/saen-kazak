<h1 id="bantext">Minecraft Engineering!</h1>

<p>

Hi! I'm Saen and I'm a coder studying Computer Science at degree level. I am also an avid Minecraft player of 10+ years. I will be using this space to document the many hobby projects I create within the scope of the game, many of which often involve extensive use of mods, server administration, plugins and redstone engineering.

I try to keep all of my hobby projects neatly tied up into one server.

One of the things I've always loved about Minecraft is the almost ridiculous ability to do absolutely <i>anything.</i> Some of my most recent hobby projects involve the construction of a large railway network
